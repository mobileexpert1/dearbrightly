      'I heard about Dear Brightly through a good friend of mine, and I’m so in LOVE now too. They were incredibly trustworthy, easy to use, and after seeing initial results, I now actually use it to upkeep my skin. My skin is clearer and fresher-looking. I recommend this to anyone in their 20s.',

      'After dealing with moderate acne for many years, I was so happy to see the difference that retinoids made! I don’t have much free time to spend on skincare but using Dear Brightly’s service is a quick step to good skin anyone can do.',

      'It hurts my wallet to know I was spending so much on a 10-step routine when all I needed was a retinoid. I’m saving so much time at night during my routine as well as in the morning when I can leave my house fresh-faced. I’m so grateful to have access to this service.',

      'Goodbye forever to spending an hr at the derm to get a prescription for a tube of toothpaste consistency, hard to spread retinoid. Hello Dear Brightly, the same exact thing for 0 time, less price, and that smooooth texture I love. Feels like a daily indulgence. Love you humans over there with the best customer service!',

      'My skin has been so much better since using a retinoid. I had never used one before, although heard of them as a holy grail. I was a bit nervous, but my derm ramped me up and eased me in by tailoring. So I felt super comfortable. Their customer service team is so good and you can tell they care.',

      'A friend of mine is a derm, and basically said that every derm uses one as a nighttime essential. I used to use retinol but finally upgraded to a retinoid. Had known of Dear Brightly for awhile, and looking back, I really can’t believe it took me so long to use.',

      'Skincare used to stress me out before Dear Brightly - I assumed I had to buy at least 10 products, and pay a lot for them. I also had no idea what products would help with my specific skin concerns. Running my own business, I barely have time to wash my face sometimes, so I love the fact that I just need to apply my retinoid and some night cream and I’m good to go.',
