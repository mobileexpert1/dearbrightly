This effective pair is part of your base for healthier skin, though each is better suited to a different time of day.

Surfactants are necessary to help grime dissolve with water, but they have the potential to damage the skin. Milk Tower only uses mild, coconut-derived surfactants that will effectively but gently cleanse.\n• HYDRATING, NOT OVERSTRIPPING: Milk Tower is made with Niacinamide, Green Tea Extract, and Boswellia Serrata Extract to moisturize, soothe, and calm.\n• DERMATOLOGIST-TESTED & FREE OF: Cruelty free, paraben free, alcohol free, and no fragrance added.",
